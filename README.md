# AWS Projects

This repository contains hands-on AWS projects built for learning, practice, and portfolio documentation. Each folder represents a standalone project demonstrating specific AWS services, architectures, and real-world use cases.

## Projects

- **DynamoDB-Tables-Project**: Learning DynamoDB tables, partition keys, sort keys, and access patterns.
- **Future Projects**: Other AWS services like Lambda, S3, IAM, VPC, and more will have their own folders with step-by-step implementation and reflections.

## Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `README.md` explaining objectives, services used, and lessons learned
- An optional `images` or `screenshots` folder for visuals
- Any scripts, CloudFormation templates, or supporting files needed to replicate the project

## Notes

- All projects are developed using a single AWS region for consistency (us-east-1 by default)
- Free Tier usage is considered for learning and testing purposes
- Documentation follows a personal, reflective style to make projects easy to understand and replicate
